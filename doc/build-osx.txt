Mac OS X gldcoind build instructions

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Litecoin-QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 intel.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer. XCode should be available on your OS X
install DVD, but if not, you can get the current version from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/


1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone https://github.com/goldcoin/gldcoin.git

2.  Download and install homebrew from https://brew.sh or use this command in Terminal:
		/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

3.  Install dependencies from homebrew

sudo brew install boost db48 openssl miniupnpc 

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
sudo brew install qrencode

4.  Now you should be able to build gldcoind:

cd gldcoin/src
	

or

make -f makefile.osx USE_IPV6=1 USE_UPNP=1 USE_QRCODE=1 64BIT=1 RELEASE=1 STATIC=1

Note: You cannot use both 64BIT=1 and 32BIT=1, as it will simply default to 32BIT

Run:
  ./gldcoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./gldcoind -daemon # to start the gldcoin daemon.
Run
  ./gldcoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands

5. To make the QT navigate to the root directory of the project, and use the following set of commands:

Build with .pro mac file.

sudo macdeployqt GoldCoin-Qt.app -dmg -verbose=1

Delete the .dmg file
